# Synology-NAS-openHAB

Hello!

This is the latest openHAB home automation installation file for Synology NAS (on december 2019). It is a SPK file which I show you how to make in my video ().

You are invited to visit my youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIOIhhPirDJH8LB0azJmd8w).

You are invited to hit LIKE on the video on youtube, COMMENT below the video and do SUBSCRIBE to my channel.
All donations are welcome (http://paypal.me/rokrodic). See description below the video.

In the video I show you how to make the latest edition of openHAB run on your Synology NAS. The original release page of this nice product is: https://github.com/openhab/openhab-syno-spk. The reason I did this video is to show you how to make it yourself as the original release page is often way beyond the time...

Donations are welcome!
